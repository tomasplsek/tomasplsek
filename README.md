## About me

I am an astrophysics PhD student at DTPA, Masaryk University in Brno, working in the High Energy Astrophysics (HEA) research group led by Prof. Norbert Werner. My work focuses on AGN feedback in giant elliptical galaxies and I specialise in the study of X-ray cavities in their hot atmospheres. I am particularly interested in image and spectral analysis of X-ray observations and the application of machine learning methods in astronomy.
