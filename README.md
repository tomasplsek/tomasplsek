## 👋 About Me

🎓 I am an astrophysics PhD student at the DTPA, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic, working in the High Energy Astrophysics ([HEA](https://hea.physics.muni.cz/)) group led by Prof. Norbert Werner. My research focuses on AGN feedback in giant elliptical galaxies, with a specialisation in the detection and characterisation of X-ray cavities in the hot atmospheres of these galaxies. I mainly focus on image and spectral analysis of X-ray observations and on applying machine learning methods to astronomical data. I am also responsible in the development of [CADET](https://github.com/tomasplsek/CADET), an image-segmentation pipeline for automatic detection of X-ray cavities.

💻 Beyond my core research, I genuinely enjoy coding, and in my free time, I like to play with home automation projects. When I step away from the screen, I play football ⚽, ride my bike 🚴, and spend time gardening 🌱.
